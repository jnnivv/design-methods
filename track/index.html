		<h1>Track</h1>
		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		We were assigned the task of tracking and visualizing some form of personal data about ourselves. The data would be collected over the course of one week. I chose to track my daydreams because I felt like I was constantly zoning out during an average day.
		
		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		I came up with a list of questions to ask myself every time I caught myself in a daydream: <br/>
		What time of day do I daydream the most?<br/>
How long do I daydream?<br/>
Where am I when I daydream?<br/>
What am I daydreaming about?<br/>
Who am I with?<br/>
Am I daydreaming on purpose, or because Iâ€™m bored, or distracted? The reason for daydreaming.<br/>
How am I feeling? Anxious? Stressed? Worried? Thoughtful?<br/>
How long d o I allow myself to daydream? Am I pulling out because someone popped my bubble, or because I thought I needed to record it, or from natural purposes?<br/>
<br/>
I soon realized I was zoning out <em>every ten minutes</em>!!

<h2>First Visualization</h2>

I received feedback saying there were too many missing data points -- like the rotation and length and position of the symbols didn't have any meaning.

<h2>Second Visualization</h2>

I decided to remake my visualization by organizing the data by day and time. Each horizontal string of symbols represents a day, and the symbols are arranged in chronological order of when I had the daydream.

<h2>Mobile Visualization</h2>
We were then tasked to represent our data on a mobile screen. You can view the site on your phone by clicking <a href="http://jnnivv.github.io/design-methods/track/track.html">here</a>. <br/><br/>
